Release 3.15
============

Availability
------------
This release is available from: 
http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.15.tar.bz2

Supported platforms
-------------------
- Fedora Core 17 (32/64 bit) with g++-4.7.0
- Fedora Core 15 (64 bit) with g++-4.6.3
- Ubuntu 12.04 (32/64 bit) with g++-4.6.3

- FreeBSD 8.2 (32 bit) with g++-4.2.1
- Cygwin 1.7.9-1 with g++-4.5.3

New user-visible features
-------------------------
- A new random variable base class called 'RandomVariableStream', has been
  introduced.  This base class derives from ns3::Object, unlike the current 
  'RandomVariable' class which is a special type of object in the ns-3 
  system to date.  By making this class derive from ns3::Object, it can be 
  handled with the Ptr class, can carry attributes, and can have its parameters
  and initial state saved in the config-store subsystem.  A new attribute
  called "Stream" has been introduced for this class, to allow users to
  better control the assignment of underlying pseudo-random sequences to
  the RandomVariableStream objects (bug 101).

----------
 - bug 101 - random variable initialization
 - bug 1256 - Unnecessary SND.NXT advance, missing ACK for Out of Order segments

ns-3.14 release.

Release 3.14
============

Availability
------------
This release is available from: 
http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.14.tar.bz2

Supported platforms
-------------------
ns-3.14 has been tested on the following platforms.  Not all features are
available on all platforms; check the Installation page on the project wiki.

- Fedora Core 17 (32/64 bit) with g++-4.7.0
- Fedora Core 16 (32/64 bit) with g++-4.6.3
- Fedora Core 15 (64 bit) with g++-4.6.3
- Ubuntu 12.04 (32/64 bit) with g++-4.6.3
- Ubuntu 11.10 (32 bit) with g++-4.6.1
- Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS (64 bit) with g++-4.4.3

- FreeBSD 8.2 (32 bit) with g++-4.2.1
- Cygwin 1.7.9-1 with g++-4.5.3

New user-visible features
-------------------------
- Transport protocol implementations (TCP, UDP) have been refactored to
  support also IPv6 connections. Dual-stacked IPv6 sockets are implemented. 
  An IPv6 socket can accept an IPv4 connection, returning the sender's 
  address as an IPv4-mapped address (IPV6_V6ONLY socket option is not 
  implemented).
- The LTE code from the LENA project has been merged, bringing in a
  significant redesign of the LTE module as well as many new features.
- An antenna module is now included, which includes different
  radiation pattern models. See the corresponding new section of the
  ns-3 models library documentation for details.
- A new buildings module is introduced which allows to model the
  presence of buildings in a wireless network topology.  
- New propagation models (OkumuraHata, ITU-R P.1411, ITU-R P.1238)
  have been added
- The Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) MANET routing protocol for IPv4 was added.
- A Random Early Detection (RED) queue model has been added.
- Ipv6RoutingHelper is now in-line with Ipv4RoutingHelper concerning the RT 
  print functions. Various minor changes were made in Ipv6RoutingProtocol and 
  derived classes to make this possible.
- New "SendIcmpv6Redirect" attribute (and getter/setter functions) to 
  Ipv6L3Protocol. The behavior is similar to Linux's conf "send_redirects",
  i.e., enable/disable the ICMPv6 Redirect sending.
- Longer and more descriptive names are used for error units in RateErrorModel
  class and queue mode in Queue class. Attributes in those classes are also
  changed for consistency. See API documentation for details.
- The netanim animator is now bundled with the release.

ns-3.11 has been tested on the following platforms.  Not all features are
available on all platforms; check the Installation page on the project wiki.

- Linux x86_64 Ubuntu 11.04
  - g++-4.5.2
- Linux i686 Ubuntu 11.04
  - g++-4.5.2, g++-4.4.5
- Linux x86_64 Fedora Core 15
  - g++-4.6.0
- Linux x86_64 Fedora Core 14
  - g++-4.5.3, g++-4.4.6, g++-4.3.4
- Linux x86_64 Fedora Core 10
  - g++-3.4.6, 4.0.4, 4.1.2, 4.2.4, 4.3.2, 4.4.0
- OS X Snow Leopard
  - g++-4.2.1 

New user-visible features
-------------------------

  - The build system has been modularized, and the source code reorganized,
    to allow for modular libraries instead of a single monolithic ns-3
    library.   User programs now link a number of smaller, per-module
    libraries depending on the dependencies expressed to the build system.  
    Source code is now being maintained in individual modules with
    consistent directory structures.

  - Python bindings have also been modularized, and the bindings are now
    generated into a 'ns' namespace instead of 'ns3' for the old
    (monolithic) bindings.  By default the bindings are now modular, with
    a backward compatibility layer for older programs.  

  - By default, example and test programs are disabled from the build.
    Users can enable them via the use of a waf command at configure time,
    or automatically through the use of a new .ns3rc file.

  - int64x64_t is a new type which allows portable and easy to write arithmetic
    calculations that require a high degree of fractional precision.

  - An interface to the Click Modular Router and an Ipv4ClickRouting
    class has been added, to allow a node to use Click for external routing.

  - An interface to an OpenFlow software implementation distribution has
    been added to allow the simulation of OpenFlow switches in ns-3.

  - ns-3 coding style requirements have been applied to the entire coding
    base, resulting in a large number of whitespace changes.  The coding 
    style has been automatically enforced by running a style checking 
    program (utils/check-style.py) that uses the uncrustify (v. 0.58)
    program to apply changes. 

  - Some documentation reorganization to split documentation between
    the ns-3 manual (primarily focusing on the ns-3 core) and a new 
    "model library" document has been started.

Release 3.10
===========

Availability
------------
This release is available from: 
http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.10.tar.bz2

Supported platforms
-------------------
ns-3.10 has been tested on the following platforms.  Not all features are
available on all platforms; check the Installation page on the project wiki.

- Linux i686 Ubuntu 10.10
  - g++-4.4.5
- Linux x86_64 Ubuntu 8.04.4

- OS X powerpc Leopard 
  - g++-4.0, g++-4.2

New user-visible features
-------------------------

   - NS-3 PyViz, a live simulation visualizer, has been added.  The 
     visualizer interacts with a running simulation, such that it uses no
     trace files. It can be most useful for debugging purposes, i.e. to
     figure out if mobility models are what you expect, where packets are
     being dropped, etc. There is also a builtin interactive python console
     that can be used to debug the state of the running objects. Although
     it is mostly written in Python, it works both with Python and pure C++
     simulations.

   - Wi-Fi MAC high classes have been reorganised in attempt to
     consolidate shared functionality into a single class. This new
     class is RegularWifiMac, and it derives from the abstract
     WifiMac, and is parent of AdhocWifiMac, StaWifiMac, ApWifiMac,
     and MeshWifiInterfaceMac. The QoS and non-QoS class variants are
     no longer, with a RegularWifiMac attribute "QosSupported"
     allowing selection between these two modes of
     operation.

   - Support for IEEE 802.11g (specifically, rates with Modulation
     Class ERP-OFDM) has been added to the wifi module. The new
     WifiModes have names of the form ErpOfdmRatexxMbps, where xx is
     the rate in Mbps (one of 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 54), and a
     WifiPhyStandard enumeration WIFI_PHY_STANDARD_80211g has been
     added to allow configuration of a Wi-Fi STA supporting ERP-OFDM,
     HR/DSSS, and DSSS rates (which some call an "802.11b/g" station).

   - Two attributes were added to WaypointMobilityModel.  The first
     "LazyNotify" (default false), if enabled to true, will suppress
     course change notifications if there are no position updates.
     The second, "InitialPositionIsWaypoint" (default false), if enabled,
     will allow an initial call to SetPosition () (before any waypoints
     have been added) to be treated as the first waypoint.

   - Regression testing is now completely performed within test.py
     rather than a separate "./waf --regression" that consults
     reference traces in the ns-3.x-ref-traces directory.  In most
     cases, the example programs whose traces were included in 
     ns-3.x-ref-traces have a corresponding test called from the
     test.py program.  It is still possible to write trace-based
     regression tests but they are now called from the test.py
     program.

   - New BulkSendApplication sends data as fast as possible up to 
     MaxBytes or unlimited if MaxBytes is zero.  Think OnOff, but 
     without the "off" and without the variable data rate. This 
     application only works with SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET 
     sockets, for example TCP sockets and not UDP sockets.

   - Extensions to the energy models:  1) a new Rakhmatov Vrudhula 
     non-linear battery model, 2) additional support for modeling 
     energy consumption in WiFi devices, 3) an example for how to add 
     energy models to a WiFi-based simulation (in examples/energy/ 
     directory).

   - New methods to print IPv4 routing tables to an output stream.

   - A replacement implementation for TCP for IPv4.  TcpSocketBase
     now replaces TcpSocketImpl.  There are subclasses defined for
     TCP Tahoe, Reno, NewReno, and the original RFC793 without
     congestion control.

   - Energy support for UAN module and Li-Ion energy model.
     Now each network node can have an associated energy source
     from which it consumes energy. The user can specify a custom
     energy model for the underwater transducer, with default values
     set for WHOI acoustic transducer. Li-Ion battery model added
     into energy models folder.

   - Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) routing protocol 
     is a proactive, table-driven routing protocol for MANETs 
     developed by Charles E. Perkins and Pravin Bhagwat in 1994. 
     This implementation is for IPv4 routing and was contributed 
     by ResilNets Research Group.

   - A novel model to simulate LTE networks has been added.  It focuses 
     mainly on modeling the E-UTRA part of the system, with a particular 
     attention on the aspects related to the channel, PHY and MAC layers. 
     The most important features available at this moment are (i) a basic 
     implementation of both the UE and the eNB devices, (ii) RRC and 
     entities for both the UE and the eNB, (iii) an Adaptive Modulation 
     and Coding (AMC) scheme for the downlink, (iv) the management of the 
     data radio bearers (with their QoS parameters), the MAC queues and 
     the RLC instances, (v) Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) management, 
     (vi) support for both uplink and downlik packet scheduling, 
     (vii) a PHY layer model with Resource Block level granularity, and 
     (viii) a channel model with the outdoor E-UTRAN propagation loss 
     model.

   - Project documentation has been converted from GNU Texinfo to Sphinx.

Release 3.9
===========

Availability
------------
This release is immediately available from:
http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.9.tar.bz2

Supported platforms
-------------------
ns-3.9 has been tested on the following platforms:
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 32/64-bit gcc-4.4.3
- Fedora Core 12 64-bit gcc-4.4.3
- Ubuntu 9.10 32-bit gcc-4.4.1

- Windows Cygwin 1.7.5

Not all ns-3 options are available on all platforms; consult the
wiki for more information:
http://www.nsnam.org/wiki/index.php/Installation

New user-visible features
-------------------------

   - A reorganisation of the construction of Wi-Fi transmit rates has
     been undertaken with the aim of simplifying the task of
     supporting further IEEE 802.11 PHYs. This work has been completed
     under the auspices of Bug 871. A consequence of this work is that
     WifiModes have a new (hopefully future-proof) naming, and
     simulations which specify rates by name will need updating. The
     list of new rate names is given in the error message produced
     when an attempt is made to use any invalid rate name (including
     those that were previously valid).

   - A new OFDM error rate model for WiFi (NistErrorRateModel); this model
     has been validated in clear-channel testbed tests.  For 802.11b, it
     uses the same underlying model as the YansErrorRateModel, but it differs
     from YansErrorRateModel for OFDM modes (802.11a/g).  The default
     YansWifiPhyHelper has been changed to use this model.

   - A new NS-2 mobility trace reader supports BonnMotion, SUMO, TraNS, 
     etc. traces.

   - An energy model for nodes and devices, including an energy source
     model and device energy models allowing energy-aware devices
     to notify the energy source about energy consumption.  

   - Rocketfuel topology dataset support for existing topology reader
     Rocketfuel project: 
     http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/networking/rocketfuel/

   - Underwater Acoustic Network (UAN) model, split in to three parts, the 
     channel, PHY, and MAC models to enable researchers to model a variety 
     of underwater network scenarios.

   - the Spectrum framework, which provides support for spectrum-aware
     Channel and PHY layer modeling. It features a set of classes that
     allows the mathematical representation of frequency dependent
     phenomena. Some example channel, propagation and device
     implementations that make use of this framework are also
     included.

http://www.nsnam.org/wiki/index.php/Installation

New user-visible features
-------------------------
  a) WiMAX net device: Allow to simulated IEEE 802.16 point to multi-point based networks 

  b) Distributed simulation for point-to-point networks using the Message 
     Passing Interface (MPI) standard.
    
  c) Matrix propagation loss model uses a two-dimensional matrix of path loss indexed 
     by source and destination nodes.

  d) Topology read system: Allows quick and easy creation of large topologies by reading 
     Inet or Orbis files

  e) Gauss-Markov mobility model: Adds 3-d adaptation of Gauss-Markov mobility model which 
     has both memory and variability

  f) Steady-state random waypoint mobility model: Based on random waypoint mobility (RWM) model for case when 
     speed, pause and position are uniformly distributed random variables. However, initial values of these

- point to point links support asymmetrical data rates.
- generate doxygen documentation for all attributes and trace sources
- add ConfigStore and GtkConfigStore to contrib module
- socket API now support tx and rx buffers: implemented for UDP and TCP
- ARP cache now supports per-entry pending queues
- lots of bugfixes and implementation and API cleanups

Warning: among API changes in this release, Application::Start and 
Application::Stop now interprets the time argument as a relative
instead of absolute simulation time, to align with how Simulator::Schedule
behaves.  Any code that calls these APIs in the middle of the simulation 
will need to be adapted.  

The API of Simulator::StopAt (time) has also changed.  Now it is 
called Simulator::Stop (time), and takes a relative time, instead of 
absolute.

Release 3.0.12 (2008/04/07)
===========================
    - Add Attribute support to the TypeId metadata system and add
attribute support to all in-tree models

    - TCP delayed acknowledgements and multitasking server

Release 3.0.11 (2008/02/15)
===========================
    - Initial port of GTNetS TCP implementation (initial version 
that does not support multitasking or delayed acknowledgments yet, 
but supports a reliable stream service)
    - Changes to the ns-3 object model to create a TypeId-based 
metadata system

       * a simple set of rate control algorithms (ARF, Ideal, 
         AARF, constant-rate)
       * adhoc and infrastructure mode (beacon+assoc)
   - Use smart pointer for Packet in the APIs
   - A new contrib directory with helper classes: 
     EventGarbageCollector, Gnuplot
   - Tracing support for Applications
   - many bugs fixed

Release 3.0.8 (2007/11/15)
==========================
   - A simple error model
   - Source files for ns-3 tutorial

Release 3.0.7 (2007/10/15)

  - Additional mobility models (random waypoint, random 2D walk)
  - A mobility visualization tool 

Release 3.0.6 (2007/09/15)
==========================
  - Static multicast IPv4 routing
  - Logging overhaul (NS_LOG macros)
  - Refactoring of tracing subsystem
  - Tutorial document started
 
Release 3.0.5 (2007/08/15)
==========================

  - Refactoring to support win32-based unix environments (Cygwin, mingw)
  - "Packet socket" for allowing applications to access NetDevices directly
  - Generalized, polymorphic Address class
  - Add CSMA NetDevice model (from Emmanuelle Laprise)
  - Modularize IPv4 routing support (from Gustavo Carneiro)
  - Add mobility framework and basic mobility models 
  - Global unicast centralized routing 

Release 3.0.4 (2007/07/15)
==========================

  - Enable waf as the default build system.
  - Per-packet metadata:  a system to track which headers and trailers 
    are added to a packet
  - Simplifications to point-to-point devices and channel

Release 3.0.3 (2007/06/15)
==========================

  - Enable Waf for release tarballs: users can now build ns-3
    with the "waf" tool. See doc/build-waf.txt.
  - Add support for variable time precision: it is now possible
    to run a simulation with an accuracy which is higher or lower
    than a nanosecond: seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, 
    femtoseconds and picoseconds are supported.
  - Optimize and rework the COM framework, solidify the component 
    manager
  - Many small API cleanups

Release 3.0.2 (2007/05/18)
