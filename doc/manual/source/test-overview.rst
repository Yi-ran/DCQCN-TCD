Overview
--------

This document is concerned with the testing and validation of |ns3| software.

This document provides

* background about terminology and software testing (Chapter 2);
* a description of the ns-3 testing framework (Chapter 3);
* a guide to model developers or new model contributors for how to write tests (Chapter 4);

In brief, the first three chapters should be read by ns developers and 
contributors who need to understand how to contribute test code and
validated programs, and
the remainder of the document provides space for people to report on what
aspects of selected models have been validated.
